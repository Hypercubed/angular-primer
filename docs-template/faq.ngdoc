# FAQ

## Why does angular-primer require angularjs 1.3 or higher?
See [https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/7383](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/7383).

## Why does angular-primer require d3?
While developing angular-primer I offloaded some of the drawing work to d3.  This dependency is very lose and may be eliminated in the future.

## Does angular-primer only visualize primers?
No, while originally designed for the visualization of DNA/RNA primers, the angular-primer directives composable elements can be used together to create a simple, or complex, SVG visualizations of any strand based genomic features.

## Who developed angular-primer?
angular-primer was developed by [Jayson Harshbarger](https://github.com/Hypercubed) at [RIKEN Yokohama institute](http://www.yokohama.riken.jp/english/).  This work was supported by a research grant from the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) to the RIKEN Center for Life Science Technologies.

## Can't I make the same visualization using R?
Yes, however, the goal of angular-primer is to create a reusable *interactive* visualization component that integrates into larger angularjs web applications.

## How can I save the resulting SVG?
If you want to download any SVG you see on a website you can try [SVG Crowbar](http://nytimes.github.io/svg-crowbar/).  If you are an angularjs app developer try using [angular-downloadsvg-directive](https://github.com/Hypercubed/angular-downloadsvg-directive).

## Something is wrong!!
