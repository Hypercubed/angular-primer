<h3 id="faq_why-does-angular-primer-require-angularjs-13-or-higher">Why does angular-primer require angularjs 1.3 or higher?</h3>
<p>See <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/7383"><a href="https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/7383">https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/7383</a></a>.</p>
<h3 id="faq_why-does-angular-primer-require-d3">Why does angular-primer require d3?</h3>
<p>While developing angular-primer I offloaded some of the drawing work to d3.  This dependency is very lose and may be eliminated in the future.</p>
<h3 id="faq_does-angular-primer-only-visualize-primers">Does angular-primer only visualize primers?</h3>
<p>No, while originally designed for the visualization of DNA/RNA primers, the angular-primer directives composable elements can be used together to create a simple, or complex, SVG visualizations of any strand based genomic features.</p>
<h3 id="faq_who-developed-angular-primer">Who developed angular-primer?</h3>
<p>angular-primer was developed by <a href="https://github.com/Hypercubed">Jayson Harshbarger</a> at <a href="http://www.yokohama.riken.jp/english/">RIKEN Yokohama institute</a>.  This work was supported by a research grant from the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) to the RIKEN Center for Life Science Technologies.</p>
<h3 id="faq_cant-i-make-the-same-visualization-using-r">Can&#39;t I make the same visualization using R?</h3>
<p>Yes, however, the goal of angular-primer is to create a reusable <em>interactive</em> visualization component that integrates into larger angularjs web applications.</p>
<h3 id="faq_how-can-i-save-the-resulting-svg">How can I save the resulting SVG?</h3>
<p>If you want to download any SVG you see on a website you can try <a href="http://nytimes.github.io/svg-crowbar/">SVG Crowbar</a>.  If you are an angularjs app developer try using <a href="https://github.com/Hypercubed/angular-downloadsvg-directive">angular-downloadsvg-directive</a>.</p>
